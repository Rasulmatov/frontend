<h2>CHAPTER I. <br> the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
<p>
    <span class="text_bold"> Alice </span> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
    having nothing to do: once or
    twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what
    is the use of a book,” thought Alice <span class="mark">“without pictures or conversations?”</span>
</p>
<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
    whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
    suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
<p>
    There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
    say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
    she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took
    a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
    flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
    out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it
    pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
